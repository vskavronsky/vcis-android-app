# \## Learning project for Kotlin Android Bootcamp

# 

# Project consist of the following parts:

# \- Main screen with side navigation, which will be the entry point to the application, and through which the users will access other features (\*\*launcher\_app module\*\*)

# 

# The project structure should conform to clean architecture principles (\[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html))  

# The base proposed layers are (\*but not limited to only them\*):

# \- domain

# \- data

# \- presentation

# 

# Project should split to modules based on features, not layers. Every module should be divided to layers accordingly to clean architecture principles. Modules without UI might have a bit different separation on layers.

# 

# \### Launcher App

# Implement UI for switching between main app features
